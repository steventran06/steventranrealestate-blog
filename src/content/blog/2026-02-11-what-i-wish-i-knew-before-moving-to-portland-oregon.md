After helping dozens of people relocate to Portland, there are a few things I consistently hear: “I didn’t expect this” or “I wish I knew that earlier.”

Here’s what most people don’t realize before moving — and what actually matters.

🏘️ Neighborhoods Matter More Than the City

Portland changes dramatically from neighborhood to neighborhood. Two areas just a few miles apart can feel like entirely different cities.

Many relocation mistakes happen when people judge Portland based on one visit or one neighborhood.

☁️ It’s Not the Rain — It’s the Gray

Rain isn’t the issue. Lack of sun is.

The gray season lasts months, and people who struggle here are usually unprepared for that. Summer, however, is incredible and often what keeps people here long-term.

🚗 Commutes Can Surprise You

Portland traffic isn’t massive, but geography and bridges create bottlenecks. Where you live matters more than how far you live.

💰 Costs Vary Widely by Area

Portland pricing isn’t uniform. Suburbs and neighborhoods vary dramatically in cost, taxes, and lifestyle.

🎯 Who Adjusts Best

People who do best:  
• Research neighborhoods deeply  
• Prioritize lifestyle over hype  
• Plan for long-term living
