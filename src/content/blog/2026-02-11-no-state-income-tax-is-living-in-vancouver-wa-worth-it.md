One of the biggest reasons people move to Vancouver, Washington is simple: no state income tax.

For high-income earners and remote workers, this can look like a major financial advantage. But is it really that straightforward?

Here’s what you need to understand before making the Oregon vs Washington decision.

💵 Income Tax vs Property Tax

Washington has:  
• No state income tax  
• Higher property taxes

Oregon has:  
• State income tax  
• No sales tax

The benefit depends heavily on:  
• Your income level  
• Where you physically work  
• Your long-term housing plans

If you physically work in Oregon, you may still owe Oregon income tax even if you live in Washington.
