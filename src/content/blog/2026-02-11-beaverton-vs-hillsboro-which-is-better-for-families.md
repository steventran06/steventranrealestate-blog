If you’re relocating to the Portland Metro Area with kids, one of the biggest decisions you’ll face is whether to live in Portland proper or in a suburb like Beaverton.

Both offer strong communities, access to nature, and diverse housing — but they feel very different day-to-day.

Lifestyle Differences

Portland offers:  
• Walkable neighborhoods  
• Historic homes and character  
• Strong cultural and food scene

Beaverton offers:  
• Quieter streets  
• Newer subdivisions  
• Larger yards and homes

For many families, daily routine matters more than nightlife or trendiness. Beaverton often wins on simplicity and convenience.

Schools & Community

Beaverton School District is one of the largest and most established in the metro area. Portland Public Schools has strong pockets but varies by neighborhood.

Researching specific school zones is critical in both areas.

Housing & Cost

Beaverton typically offers:  
• More square footage for the price  
• Newer construction

Portland offers:  
• Walkability  
• Older architectural charm

Final Takeaway

Choose Portland if you prioritize urban lifestyle and culture. Choose Beaverton if you want space, schools, and suburban calm.
