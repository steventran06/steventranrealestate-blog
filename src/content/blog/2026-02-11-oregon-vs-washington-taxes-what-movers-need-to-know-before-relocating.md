One of the biggest financial decisions in the Portland Metro Area isn’t which neighborhood you choose — it’s which state you live in.

Oregon and Washington have very different tax structures, and understanding the trade-offs can significantly impact your long-term finances.

💡 Which Is Better?

It depends on:  
• Your income level  
• Whether you work physically in Oregon  
• How long you plan to stay  
• Your spending patterns

There is no universal “better” state — only what aligns with your situation.
