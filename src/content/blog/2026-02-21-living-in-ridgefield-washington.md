Ridgefield is one of the fastest-growing communities in Southwest Washington. Located north of Vancouver, it attracts buyers seeking new construction, larger homes, and suburban quiet.

Developments in Ridgefield often feature modern layouts, larger lots, and contemporary design — appealing to families and remote workers. Washington’s lack of state income tax adds another layer of appeal for certain buyers.

However, commuting into Portland requires crossing I-5 or I-205 bridges, which can bottleneck during peak hours. Ridgefield is best suited for remote or hybrid professionals who don’t commute daily.

Growth in the area continues, supporting housing demand, but buyers should carefully weigh commute realities against space and tax considerations.
