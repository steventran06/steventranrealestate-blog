  Know Before Moving"

If you’re thinking about moving to Hillsboro, Oregon, you’re not alone. Hillsboro is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Portland Metro Area and a popular choice for people relocating for tech jobs, newer housing, and long-term stability.

Some people move here for work opportunities. Others are drawn by newer neighborhoods and more space. But Hillsboro isn’t the right fit for everyone.

I live and work in the Portland Metro Area, I’m a real estate investor, and I help people relocate to Hillsboro regularly. Here’s an honest look at what living in Hillsboro is really like — the good, the trade-offs, and who it’s best for.

🌲 Lifestyle & Access to Nature

Hillsboro offers a quieter, suburban lifestyle with plenty of green space.

You’re close to:  
• Local parks and trails  
• Wine country in the Tualatin Valley  
• The Oregon Coast and Mount Hood within a reasonable drive

It’s less dense than Portland, which many families and remote workers see as a benefit.

Homes often feel newer and more uniform than Portland’s older neighborhoods.

• MAX light rail connects Hillsboro to Portland

Living closer to work makes a noticeable difference.
