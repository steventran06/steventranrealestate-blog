  Know Before Moving"

If you’re thinking about moving to Beaverton, Oregon, you’re not alone. Beaverton is one of the most searched suburbs in the Portland Metro Area, especially for people relocating from California, Washington, Texas, and other higher-cost regions.

Some people are drawn to Beaverton for its job access and schools. Others want more space while staying close to Portland. But like any city, Beaverton has trade-offs that are worth understanding before you make the move.

I live and work in the Portland Metro Area, I’m a real estate investor, and I help people relocate to Beaverton and the surrounding suburbs every week. Here’s an honest breakdown of what it’s really like to live in Beaverton — the good, the not-so-good, and who this area is actually best for.

* * *

The Lifestyle & Access to Nature

Beaverton offers a strong balance between suburban living and outdoor access.

You’re close to:  
• Forest Park and the Tualatin Hills Nature Park  
• Local trails, parks, and green spaces  
• The Oregon Coast and Mount Hood within a reasonable drive

While Beaverton feels more suburban than Portland proper, you still get the Pacific Northwest lifestyle — greenery, outdoor recreation, and easy weekend escapes.

From a long-term perspective, this combination of lifestyle and convenience continues to drive demand in Beaverton.

Food, Coffee & Everyday Amenities

Beaverton doesn’t get as much attention as Portland for food, but it shouldn’t be overlooked.

You’ll find:  
• A diverse food scene, including some of the best Asian cuisine in the metro  
• Local coffee shops and bakeries  
• Breweries and casual dining  
• Easy access to grocery stores, shopping centers, and services

Beaverton is less about nightlife and more about day-to-day livability. For many people, that trade-off is a positive.

* * *

Jobs & Economic Stability

One of Beaverton’s biggest advantages is its employment base.

Major employers and industries include:  
• Nike World Headquarters  
• Technology and engineering firms  
• Healthcare  
• Manufacturing and logistics

Beaverton isn’t a one-industry town. That diversity helps support long-term housing demand and economic stability. It’s also a popular option for remote workers who want more space while staying close to Portland.

The Weather: Similar to Portland, for Better or Worse

Beaverton shares the same climate as Portland.

Expect:  
• Mild summers  
• A long gray season from late fall through early spring  
• Less heavy rain than many people expect, but frequent overcast days

If sunshine year-round is critical for you, this is something to consider seriously. That said, summers in Beaverton are dry, comfortable, and one of the biggest perks of living in the area.

* * *

Cost of Living & Housing Prices

Beaverton is not a low-cost city, but it can offer better value than some parts of Portland.

Housing tends to provide:  
• More square footage  
• Larger lots  
• Newer construction options

Prices vary significantly based on:  
• School districts  
• Proximity to employers  
• Access to highways and transit

For buyers relocating from higher-cost West Coast metros, Beaverton often feels like a strong value relative to space and quality of life.

* * *

Traffic, Commute & Infrastructure

Commute patterns matter a lot in Beaverton.

Key considerations:  
• Highway 26 and Highway 217 are major commuter routes  
• Traffic can build quickly during peak hours  
• MAX light rail provides car-free access to Portland

Where you live within Beaverton can dramatically affect your daily routine. A short distance difference can mean a big change in commute time.

* * *

Neighborhood Variety Across Beaverton

Beaverton isn’t just one type of neighborhood.

You’ll find:  
• Quiet, established residential areas  
• Newer subdivisions  
• Townhomes and condos near transit  
• Mixed-use developments with walkability

Some areas feel very suburban, while others feel more connected and urban. This variety is one of Beaverton’s strengths — but it also means choosing the right neighborhood is critical.

* * *

The Honest Middle Ground

Beaverton works extremely well for certain lifestyles, but it’s not for everyone.

It’s a great fit if you:  
• Want strong schools and family-friendly neighborhoods  
• Prefer a quieter environment than downtown Portland  
• Value space and convenience  
• Work west of Portland or remotely

It may not be ideal if you:  
• Want a highly urban, nightlife-focused lifestyle  
• Prefer historic homes and dense walkability  
• Don’t want to rely on a car at all

Who Beaverton Is Actually Great For

Based on the people I help relocate, Beaverton is especially well-suited for:  
• First-time buyers thinking long-term  
• Families planning to stay put for several years  
• Professionals working in Washington County  
• Remote workers seeking space without isolation  
• Buyers comparing Portland vs suburbs

With the right expectations and location, Beaverton can be an excellent long-term choice.

Final Thoughts

Living in Beaverton offers a practical, balanced alternative to Portland. You get strong job access, good schools, suburban comfort, and proximity to both nature and the city.

As with anywhere in the Portland Metro Area, the experience depends heavily on neighborhood choice, commute patterns, and lifestyle priorities.
