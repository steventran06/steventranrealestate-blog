First-time buyers need a mix of affordability, stability, and growth potential.

**Top Options**  
Tigard  
Hillsboro  
Gresham  
Happy Valley  
Outer Beaverton

What to Consider

• Entry price point  
• Commute impact  
• Long-term appreciation

One often ignored city is Vancouver, WA, which has amazing benefits:

*   No state income tax(CAVEAT: if you can work in the state of Washington)
    
*   Lower price points
    
*   A growing downtown and waterfront area that will add tons of value to the city
    

Buying in the right suburb can set up strong long-term equity growth. I'm happy to help discussing each of these neighborhoods and why they would make a great fit. Take a look at my relocation guide below for more information.
